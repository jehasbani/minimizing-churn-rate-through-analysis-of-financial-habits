# Minimizing churn rate through analysis of financial habits

## Introduction
Subscription products are often the main source of revenue for companies across all industries. Regardless of how they structure their memberships, companies almost always try to minimize customer churn rate (subscription cancellations). To retain their customers, these companies need first to identify the patters that act as a catalyst in disengagement with product.

Here are some key definitions:

*   **Market:** The target audience is the entirety of the company's subscription base. They are the ones the companies aim to keep.
*   **Product:** The subscription products that customers are already enrolled in can provide value that users may not have imagined, or may have forgotten.
*   **Goal:**The objective of this model is to predict which users are likely to churn, so that the users can focus on re-engaging them with the product.
